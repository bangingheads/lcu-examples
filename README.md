# LCU Examples Repository
This repo includes examples for the League of Legends client (LCU) API. These examples will include all common uses of the API and will be thoroughly commented.

Examples will be separated by folders by use with the file describing the example. Along with this is comments of what the code performs at the beginning of the code.

All examples are in Python using [LCU Driver](https://github.com/sousa-andre/lcu-driver) (Shoutout to [Andr√©](https://github.com/sousa-andre)). They should be very easily be ported into other programming languages.

## Additional Resources
All endpoints for the LCU can be found using Mingwei's [LCU Swagger](https://www.mingweisamuel.com/lcu-schema/tool/#/).

You can find libraries for other languages on the [Awesome League](https://github.com/CommunityDragon/awesome-league) repository or by searching GitHub.

Additional questions can be asked on the [Riot Games Third Party Community Discord](https://discord.gg/riotgamesdevrel).
